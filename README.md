# Python Project Template

## Description

This repository is a typical example of a data science project written in Python and is used for testing purposes when
we need to have a more truthful example of an algorithm in use by the Dutch Government.

The typical steps will be done:

1. prepping data
2. training models
3. evaluating models
4. serving a result
5. monitoring

This is all done with the PyCaret framework for now, a large set of frameworks like Tensorflow or lightgbm could be
filled in at a later stage.
